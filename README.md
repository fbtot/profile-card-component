## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I don't write code since 2013. This project was great to refresh some knowledge (like how to position multiple background images). I never used CSS grids and flexbox before.

### Continued development

CSS grids and flexbox and HTML5 semantic tags.

### Useful resources

- [Controlling background-images | CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_Jy1CqH9k&t=368s) - I had difficulties with the positioning of the background images. This tutorial by Kevin Powell helped.
